            I am a Programming Engineering and Webmaster student, currently
            focused on becoming a Full Stack Developer. Although I am still
            pursuing my academic studies, I have worked on several academic and
            personal projects that have allowed me to gain hands-on experience
            in building functional and efficient applications.
          </p>
          <p className="another-text">
            My professional goal is to join a development team where I can
            contribute my skills, continue learning, and grow as a software
            developer. I am passionate about solving problems through code,
            applying best practices, and creating solutions that deliver real
            value. This website showcases a selection of my projects to
            demonstrate my abilities, commitment, and approach to development.
